# Sample Rails app with isomorphic React components

This is a simple proof-of-concept Rails app that uses the 1.x prerelease version of the [react-rails gem], which lets us:

- render
- mount the same React component on top of the server-rendered DOM client side (via an unobtrusive JS adapter)

To get the app running:

- bundle install
- rake db:migrate
- rake db:seed
- rails server
